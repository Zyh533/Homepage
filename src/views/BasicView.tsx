                    Welcome and thank you for visiting my site! I'm a Ph.D candidate at

                        (IDG) </a> of State key Lab of Cad & CG,
                    College of Computer Technology, Zhejiang University, supervised by Prof.
                    Yingcai Wu. I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree of Computer Science and Technology from Zhejiang

                    I used to be a data journalist and learned design and coding by myself. I am enthusiastic about
                    telling story with data and communicating data insights to the masses. Currently, my research
                    interest mainly lies in data-driven storytelling, data visualization design, human-computer
                    interaction, and intelligent visualization.

                <div className={classes.paragraph}>
                    I pay close attention to the application of data visualization in industries such as data
                    journalism, digital humanism, and business intelligence. I believe that visual literacy and data
                    related skills are vital in the big data era. I am also a part-time writer running a blog / writing
                    books / organizing events in China to introduce the latest progression and application of data
                    visualization as well as teaching visualization skills.
